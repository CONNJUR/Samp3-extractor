### Instructions ###

1. run the samp3_extractor.sh shell script in the directory of the samp3 
   analysis data.  This will extract all versions of the JSON dump file
   from the git history

2. run the spextractor/dump2star.py or spextractor/stardiff.py modules,
   depending on what you're trying to do

3. the final result is a single NMR-STAR file using the new data dictionary
   extensions
